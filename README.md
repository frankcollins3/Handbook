# Handbook
Meta Glasses concept: determinable, customizable, hand-sign preference package manager

#### user stores
i.e. (upload photo to instagram by holding heart sign in front of glasses)
// timeout settings would be programmable by text or hand-sign as well i.e. 1-5 fingers held same place as original hand sign as representation for 1k-5kms
countdown corresponds to command.

so:
heart ->
3 fingers ->
3-2-1 glasses take photo.
Upload to your favorite platform. (i'm building one [which could fail] so hopefully permits integration) 

Handbook because facebook. play on words and concept is donation from yours:boolean = true;
